Furby AI is a project where I have adapted and modified an exisiting Furby toy animotronic to be used as a personal assitant. All of the code was written by myself, and all of the hardwear was modified and set up by myself, with advising from the UMKC Robotics team.

Tech Stack:
- Rasberri Pi 4: Used to control the Body of the furby, as well as audio input and output.
- Desktop Linux (Ubuntu) Machine: Used to run DeepSeek-r1(1.5b) with Ollama for an offline LLM to process user prompts
